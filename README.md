# CNNFlowersRecognition
___
The aim of this project is to try to build a flower classification model that can classify flower images into 102 categories.

the data used to train the models is _the 102-flowers dataset_ (This <a href=http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html>DATASET</a> was created by the Visual Geometry Group of Oxford University, and contains at least 40 examples for each of 102 types of flowers). The 102 categories (and numbers of examples for each) is described <a href=http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/categories.html> HERE</a>.
